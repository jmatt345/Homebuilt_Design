# Homebuilt_Design
Using Python and Dan Raymer's Simplified Aircraft Design for Homebuilders to design an airplane.

This project is an attempt to use the Python programming language and the formula's found in Dr. Raymer's book to design an aircraft capable of being built by a homebuilder.  The user will enter desired characteristics and the program will output the resulting dimensional parameters.  The dimensional parameters will then be imported into and rendered in Blender.
